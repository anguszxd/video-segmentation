Description: 
            PyMaxflow is a Python library for graph construction and
            maxflow computation (commonly known as `graph cuts`). The
            core of this library is the C++ implementation by
            Vladimir Kolmogorov, which can be downloaded from his
            `homepage <http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/V.Kolmogorov/>`_.
            Besides the wrapper to the C++ library, PyMaxflow offers
        
            * NumPy integration,
            * methods for the construction of common graph
              layouts in computer vision and graphics,
            * implementation of algorithms for fast energy
              minimization which use the `maxflow` method:
              the alpha-beta-swap and the alpha-expansion.
